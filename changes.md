Here’s a short explanation of **why `pnpm` is better than `npm`**, useful when explaining it to your team:

---

### ✅ Why `pnpm` > `npm` (in short):

1. **⚡ Faster Installs**:
   `pnpm` uses a **content-addressable store** and **hard links**, so dependencies are not repeatedly downloaded or copied—just linked. Huge speed boost.

2. **📦 Disk Space Saver**:
   Instead of duplicating packages across projects like `npm`, `pnpm` **shares one global store**, saving **gigabytes** of space.

3. **🛡️ Strict Dependency Isolation**:
   `pnpm` doesn’t allow packages to access undeclared dependencies—this **prevents hidden bugs** and enforces cleaner `package.json`.

4. **📈 Better Monorepo Support**:
   It’s designed with **monorepos in mind**, making it ideal for large-scale projects.

So you can say:

> "We could've used `pnpm` instead of `npm` for faster installs, less disk usage, and stricter dependency management—especially useful if this scales into a monorepo."
