Here’s a polished **presentation script** based on your assignment:

---

**🗣️ Script — HubSpot Integration Demo**

---

**1️⃣ Intro**

> "Hi, I’m Srisailam. Today, I’ll walk you through my implementation of the HubSpot integration assignment."

---

**2️⃣ Show the Full OAuth Flow Live**

* Start on the frontend.

> "First, I’ll connect my account to HubSpot by clicking ‘Connect to HubSpot’. This kicks off the OAuth 2.0 flow using PKCE for security."

* Show the HubSpot login & consent screen.
* After approval, show the frontend confirming the connection.

---

**3️⃣ Explain File Roles Briefly**

> "The integration mainly lives in `hubspot.py`.

* `authorize_hubspot()` generates the state, PKCE challenge, stores it in Redis, and builds the authorization URL.
* `oauth2callback_hubspot()` handles the callback from HubSpot, validates the state, and exchanges the code for tokens.
* `get_hubspot_credentials()` fetches stored tokens from Redis.
* `get_items_hubspot()` uses the access token to fetch contacts from HubSpot’s CRM API.
* `IntegrationItem` is our common data format for displaying external items in the app."

---

**4️⃣ Walk Through Backend Flow**

> "When the user clicks connect:

1. We generate a random state and PKCE code verifier for CSRF and replay protection.
2. These are stored temporarily in Redis (10 min TTL).
3. HubSpot sends us back an authorization code.
4. We verify the state, fetch the PKCE code verifier from Redis, and exchange the code for access and refresh tokens.
5. The tokens are stored securely in Redis under a namespaced key per user/org."

---

**5️⃣ Security Considerations**

> "I chose Redis because it’s fast, supports TTLs for auto-expiry, and avoids writing sensitive data to disk.
> Tokens expire automatically after the TTL.
> PKCE adds a layer of protection against code interception attacks."

---

**6️⃣ HubSpot Endpoints Choice**

> "I used the `/crm/v3/objects/contacts` endpoint to fetch contacts because it’s the most common CRM use case.
> The scopes we request are the minimum needed: read & write contacts, read company schemas, and the `oauth` scope."

---

**7️⃣ Show IntegrationItem List Output**

* Call `get_items_hubspot()` live.
* Show formatted contact list in frontend.

> "These contacts are normalized into our `IntegrationItem` model so the UI can handle them like any other integration source."

---

**8️⃣ Production-Readiness**

> "Here’s what makes this production-friendly:

* **Redis TTLs** to clean up stale OAuth states and credentials.
* **Error handling** for bad states, missing scopes, expired tokens, and HubSpot API failures.
* **Scalable structure** so adding another CRM would mean just implementing the same functions for that provider."

---

**9️⃣ Wrap-Up**

> "That’s my HubSpot integration — secure, scalable, and ready for production. The next step would be adding automated tests and refresh token handling for long-term connections."

If you want, I can also make a **slide-friendly diagram** of this flow so you can present it visually while talking. That would make your demo way more engaging.
