Perfect, Sri — this is your moment to **position yourself as a senior backend dev** with **production-grade standards, secure practices, clean architecture, and deep understanding of integrations.**

Here’s a **battle-tested roadmap**, broken into:

> ✅ Goals → 🛠️ Execution Plan → 💡 Tips to Stand Out

---

## 🎯 YOUR GOAL:

To make them say **“Whoa, this guy is already thinking like our teammate”**.

To do that:

* ✅ Fully implement the **HubSpot OAuth + Data Fetch**
* ✅ Use clean, modular, scalable, **production-level code**
* ✅ Bake in **security**, **error handling**, and **documentation**
* ✅ Ship with a **clear walkthrough video** and **professional README**
* ✅ Showcase soft skills: clarity, ownership, communication

---

## 📅 FULL ROADMAP: Step-by-Step Plan

---

### ✅ **DAY 1 (Today – Thurs/Fri)** – *Setup, Understand, Plan*

#### 🔹 1. Project Setup

* [ ] Clone the repo
* [ ] Install frontend and backend dependencies
* [ ] Setup Redis (use `redis-server`)
* [ ] Create `.env` or use FastAPI config management for:

  * `HUBSPOT_CLIENT_ID`
  * `HUBSPOT_CLIENT_SECRET`
  * `HUBSPOT_REDIRECT_URI`

#### 🔹 2. Read & Understand

* [ ] Understand how `airtable.py` and `notion.py` OAuth flows work
* [ ] Understand how `integration-form.js` → `airtable.js` works
* [ ] Map how the **popup-based OAuth** and **token exchange** process flows
* [ ] Study the `IntegrationItem` class: which fields are filled per integration?

#### 🔹 3. Create HubSpot App (for testing)

* [ ] Go to [HubSpot Developer Portal](https://developers.hubspot.com/)
* [ ] Create an app → get:

  * `Client ID`
  * `Client Secret`
  * `Redirect URI`
* [ ] Enable necessary scopes:

  * e.g., `crm.objects.contacts.read`, `oauth`, etc.

---

### ✅ **DAY 2 (Fri/Sat)** – *Backend OAuth + Frontend Integration*

#### 🔹 4. Backend – HubSpot OAuth

* [ ] Implement:

  * `authorize_hubspot()` → redirect user to HubSpot login
  * `oauth2callback_hubspot()` → exchange code for tokens
  * Store access tokens securely in Redis (`redis_client.py`)

#### 🔹 5. Frontend

* [ ] In `hubspot.js`:

  * Create OAuth connect button
  * Reuse logic from `airtable.js` (popup flow)
* [ ] Add **HubSpot** to:

  * `integration-form.js`
  * Any dropdowns/lists showing integrations

---

### ✅ **DAY 3 (Sat Night/Sun)** – *Data Fetching + Productionization*

#### 🔹 6. Backend – `get_items_hubspot()`

* [ ] Use the stored token to hit [HubSpot CRM APIs](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/crm/contacts)
* [ ] Fetch contacts/deals/companies — whichever fits best
* [ ] Map response to `IntegrationItem`:

  ```python
  IntegrationItem(
      id=contact["id"],
      title=contact["properties"].get("firstname", ""),
      url=f"https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/{portal_id}/contact/{contact_id}",
      ...
  )
  ```

#### 🔹 7. Secure + Clean Backend

* [ ] Use `.env` and **do not hardcode** credentials
* [ ] Sanitize Redis keys (e.g., use prefixes, expiry time)
* [ ] Wrap all HTTP calls in `try/except`
* [ ] Add logging where helpful
* [ ] Add docstrings and type hints

---

### ✅ **DAY 4 (Sunday)** – *Wrap Up, Polish, Record*

#### 🔹 8. UI Polish

* [ ] Show success messages
* [ ] Add loading indicators
* [ ] Print results to console (as requested)
* [ ] BONUS: render fetched HubSpot data visually

#### 🔹 9. Final Touches

* [ ] Add a clean `README.md`:

  * How to run frontend + backend
  * How the OAuth flow works
  * Assumptions, known issues, how you'd improve further
  * Example `.env.example`

* [ ] Add `.gitignore` for `.env`, `__pycache__`, `node_modules`, etc.

#### 🔹 10. Record Your Screen (5–7 min)

Use Loom or OBS. Keep it crisp and confident.

**🗣️ Suggested Script:**

> "Hi, I’m Srisailam. Here’s my implementation of the HubSpot integration assignment."

* Show full OAuth flow live
* Explain what each file does briefly
* Walk through backend flow:

  * How you handled token exchange
  * How you secured storage in Redis
  * Why you chose those HubSpot endpoints
* Show IntegrationItem list output
* Talk about production-readiness:

  * Redis TTLs
  * Error handling
  * Scalable structure

---

### ✅ Submission

1. **Zip code** as `Srisailam_Kakurala_technical_assessment.zip`
2. **Name screen recording** as `Srisailam_Kakurala_screenrecording.mp4`
3. Upload both to: [Google Form Submission Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/138T1jjqbgNz6sHHegvZBLLL9iQhxPLVDBzNY-DYCiEw/edit)

---

## 💡 Extra Credit (Only if time permits)

* [ ] Add optional **Slack** OAuth (even partial)
* [ ] Write unit tests for `hubspot.py` functions
* [ ] Add `Dockerfile` for backend
